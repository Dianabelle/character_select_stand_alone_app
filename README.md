# Embedded Character List Collection Project    
## We are currently planning to make the complete list of IL model Embedded Characters, please refer to the following parameters for testing.    

Once you are sure that certain characters exist, save their names in txt or csv format and submit them to me, one name per line, just the characterâ€˜s name.    
I'll collate the thumbnails and list in later update.    
**Please note: Only one tag is allowed for Embedded Characters**

# Hires Fix and Image Color Transfer
Please refer to [Image Color Transfer](https://github.com/mirabarukaso/ComfyUI_Mira#image-color-transfer) for more details about Image Color Transfer.   

1. WeuUI will(I think...) download upscale models itself, select any model end with `(W)` will work for WebUI.   
2. Comfyui needs to download upscale models by yourself. Select `Manager`->`Model Manager` and filter with `upscale`, then download them.   
3. Upscale model list can be modity in your `settings.json` -> `api_hf_upscaler_list`    
3.1. For WebUI, copy and paste them from WebUI, and add `(W)` in the end.        
3.2. For ComfyUI, check your model's name from `ComfyUI/models/upscale_models`, and add `(C)` in the end.

# FAQ
## Not working???
Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.11~3.13 recommend.     

Then copy and paste the following command into your command line with Python environment.    
```
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## ComfyUI API not working???
Load `examples\workflow_comfyui.png` in to your ComfyUI, and make sure you have install all custom nodes below:   

[ComfyUI-Image-Saver](https://github.com/alexopus/ComfyUI-Image-Saver)   
[ComfyUI_Mira](https://github.com/mirabarukaso/ComfyUI_Mira)   

## WebUI API works, but WebUI not working anymore!!!
It seems some plugin caused that issue, try update to the latest version.    
Still not working? Unfortunately, you can't use both the API and WebUI in this case unless you uninstall the buggy plugin.   

## WebUI Http 500 / ComfyUI model not found
Make sure you have `waiNSFWIllustrious_v110` model in your `models/Stable-diffusion` folder.    
Check `Setup Model List` section, setup your proper models folder and set `model_filter` to `false`
